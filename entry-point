main entry point is function schedul() in sched.c

used by rest of kernel to invoke scheduler

schedule() is generic with respect to scheduler classes;

finds highest priorotity class with runnable process and asks it for next process to run



static inline struct task_struct *
pick_next_task(struct rq *rq)
{
  const struct sched_class *class;
  struct task_struct *p;

  /// optimization; skip rt

  while (1)
  {
    p = class->pick_next_task(rq)
    if (p) return p;

    /* idle will alwasy return non-null p, if nothing else */
    class = class->next;
  }
}
